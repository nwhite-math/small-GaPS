# Small-scale cubic Galileon Potential Solver (small-GaPS)

Open source code accompanying the article _Robust numerical computation of the 3D scalar potential field of the cubic Galileon gravity model at solar system scales_ by Nicholas C. White, Sandra M. Troian, Jeffrey B. Jewell, Curt J. Cutler, Sheng-wey Chiow, and Nan Yu. [https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02648](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02648). For details on the motivation and design of the code, please see that paper.

## Use
Instructions for use can be found in [the reference manual](reference_manual.pdf).

## Reproducing results from the paper
Parameter files corresponding to the paper results are in the directory `param_files/paper_param_files`. These can be executed by running `paper_sims_run.m`.

Instead of rerunning those simulations yourself, you may also find full output datasets for all results in the paper at [https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/nwhite-cubic-galileon-sun-earth-moon](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/nwhite-cubic-galileon-sun-earth-moon).
